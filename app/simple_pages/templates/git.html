            <h3>Branches</h3>
            <div style="font-size: 14px;">In Git, branches serve the purpose as snapshots to any changes made in your development process. If you're familiar with the C++ programming language, branches are almost similar to pointers, where the initial reference or 'main branch' is not altered when you make changes to a branch. Branches essentially make a new working directory with new commits recording the project history.</div>

            <h3>Merge</h3>
            <div style="font-size: 14px;">Merging in Git allows different branches of development to essentially become one. For example, if one feature was developed in our 'Feature 1' branch and another in our 'Feature 2' branch, we can essentially merge these two Feature branches to one another or make a new branch that implements both features.</div>
